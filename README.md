# COS70008 - Enron Email Extraction  

This repository contains the scripts and notebooks for extracting and processing the Enron email dataset.  

## Important
- **Large dataset files are NOT in GitHub.**  
- All big files (e.g. `Emails.parquet`, `.tar.gz`, `.xlsx`) are stored in our shared **OneDrive** folder.  

## Files in this repo
- `extract_emails.py`: Script to parse and convert the raw dataset into structured format.  
- `untar_fix.py`: Helper script to unpack `.tar.gz` files.  
- `README.md`: Project overview and usage notes.  

## How to use
1. Clone this repo.  
2. Download the dataset files from OneDrive.  
3. Place them in the project folder.  
4. Run the scripts (e.g., `extract_emails.py`) as needed.
